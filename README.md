# Sorting Algorithm Selector
Sorting Algorithm Selector is a program that implements various sorting techniques, 
including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
This program prompts the user to input the size of the array and the array values,
and then determines the most suitable sorting technique for the input.
The program chooses the best fit based on the analysis of the input values using heuristics such as the size of the array, 
the number of items that are out of order, and the range of values. The selected sorting technique is then explained in detail,
including its time complexity, advantages, and disadvantages. The program also explains why the other t
echniques were not chosen and why they would not be a good fit for the input.
